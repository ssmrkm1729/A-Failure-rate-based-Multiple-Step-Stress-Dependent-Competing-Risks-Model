## Source of the  Dataset used

The dataset `dataset_ssm.xlsx` used in this repository was taken from:

Zhou, Y., Lu, Z., Shi, Y., Cheng, K.: *The copula-based method for statistical analysis of step-stress accelerated life test with dependent competing failure modes*.  
Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part O: Journal of Risk and Reliability 233(3), 401â€“418 (2019)  
(https://doi.org/10.1177/1748006x18793251)


## Repository Structure

- `code/` : Contains 4 independent R scripts:
  - `MOBBXII.R`
  - `MOBCh.R`
  - `MOBE.R`
  - `MOBW.R`
  - `dataset_ssm.xlsx` : Required Excel dataset for all scripts
- `results/` : Contains outputs corresponding to the scripts.

## How to Use

1. Open any `.R` script in **RStudio** or any R environment.  
2. Ensure `dataset_ssm.xlsx` is located in the `code/` folder.  
3. Run the script to reproduce analyses (results will be displayed or saved if the script is designed to do so).

## Required R Packages

The scripts require the following R packages:

- `numDeriv`  
- `openxlsx`  
- `english`  
- `SMPracticals`  
- `readxl`  
- `plotly`  
- `RColorBrewer`  
- `survival`  
- `processx`  
- `orca`  
- `BoutrosLab.plotting.general`
